WhatsApp.


In this project, my goal is to recreate WhatsApp Web.


The app will simulate the working of the real version, in particular regarding how data is handled. This part will be achieved with Vue.js . This implies having fake contacts with corresponding chats and messages.
A search bar for contacts, a text field to send messages and many other options.

The main features of the app are:

👉 Contact list informations will be created and inserted with Vue.js.

👉 When clicking a contact in the list, the corresponding chat should open and contain only conversations with contact selected.

👉 The text field can now take user's input, meaning user can now write something and send it. The message will be displayed differently from the messages received

👉 To recreate a real conversation, everytime the user sends a text an answer ("ok") should follow 1s after.

👉 The search bar in the contact list can now filter the list based on user's input.
